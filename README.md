android-circular-progress-bar
=============================

A customizable circular progress bar for Android.

# Why use this?

We wanted a circular progress bar with a customizable starting point, direction, and complex gradients.  We found that we couldn't do that with the stock Android components (ring shape, sweep gradient, etc.).  So we built our own.

# Examples

## Beautiful gradients

## Custom starting points

## Custom directions

# Installation

## Gradle

## Maven

## Jar
